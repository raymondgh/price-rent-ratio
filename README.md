# Price to Rent Ratio with Zillow Data

I downloaded county-level data from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) and used [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) to plot one month's data on a US Map. The map is drawn using [GeoJSON data](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/blob/master/examples/data/us_counties_20m_topo.json) also from the Folium package. The list of GEO_IDs in geo_id.csv is produced from another project of mine which collected data from the US Census Bureau and as of April 2018, matches the list of 3,142 counties on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_and_county_equivalents).
